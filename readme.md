## Notes

From: https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-typescript-cdk-serverless-react

node: 23.7

aws-cli: aws-cli/2.23.12

Created an IAM user aws-cli with access key (not the IAM Identity Center!)

Created user, set to us-east-1/json and ready to go!

## Setup

We don't have a package.json, so we install the packages globally.

```
npm i -g typescript
npm i -g ts-node
npm i -g aws-cdk
```
